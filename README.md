Spotify Data Personal Project

Welcome to my Spotify Data Personal Project! In this project, I delved into languages such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, utilizing frameworks to craft a dynamic and visually appealing webpage for my application.

Purpose:
This application mirrors the concept of "Spotify Wrapped," offering a personalized year-end summary of your most-listened songs and artists. The core of the app lies in an algorithm I developed to identify your top tracks and artists over specific timeframes.

Algorithm:
Differing from Spotify Wrapped, my algorithm factors in the fractional playtime of each song. This means that song durations are considered proportionally, preventing longer songs from dominating your most-played list simply because they are lengthier. The algorithm compares the duration you spent listening to a song against its total duration, providing a more nuanced and accurate reflection of your listening habits.
